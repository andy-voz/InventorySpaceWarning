Limited inventory space can lead to a very unpleasant surprise. It's annoying to monitor the inventory space to be sure you don't need to trade your stuff yet.

This addon adds an indicator to warn you if you're running low on the inventory space:

The indicator is movable, so you can place it where you want.

You can also configure the exact number of free slots at witch the indicator should appear:
